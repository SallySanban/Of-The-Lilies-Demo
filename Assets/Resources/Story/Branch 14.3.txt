"With your family, with the curses, I will be right there with you."

Ahlai as You "Then it shouldn't be a surprise that we have a long journey ahead of us. Let's <b>get to rest</b>. Good night, Seiji."

Ahlai as You "Lady Sabina...? What time is it?"

Sabina as Lady Sabina "Just before dawn. Was it the nightmares, dear? You look distressed."

Ahlai as You "Yes, the nightmares. The same story with the general and the same damn atrocities."

Sabina as Lady Sabina "..."

Ahlai as You "And... and it's even the same set of thoughts that enter my mind. I don't have it in me to forgive him."

"What I <i>do</i> know is that I need to see my family free..."

"I need to do something to take back what our people lost..."

"And I <i>need</i> to see that cursed general suffer for what he took away from us. Without a single thought--"

Sabina as Lady Sabina "<playerName>, well... I suppose you are right. But you have to remember that this isn't healthy to obsess over."

"At least for your sake, while you <b>try to find peace from all of this.</b>"

Ahlai as You "I'll find peace when I find my family free and our enemies dead. It's as far as I am willing, at least... for now."

Sabina as Lady Sabina "It is your decision, dear. Take some time to think it over."

"When you've calmed down, <b>come down to the back room</b>. There is something important I need to tell you."
