pixel Ahlai as <playerName> "Yet you never ask me for anything in return."

pixel Sabina as Lady Sabina "Well, that's because you don't have to return any favors, dear."

pixel Sabina as Lady Sabina "Seeing you grow into the amazing people you've become is enough of a reward. Think of me as your second guardian or mother, please."

pixel Ahlai as <playerName> "Yes, there is, Lady. I want to ask for your help again."

pixel Sabina as Lady Sabina "What is it? What can I do?"

pixel Ahlai as <playerName> "I'd like your permission to journey out of Kuchai to find my family. I want to know how they're doing, and where they are."

pixel Sabina as Lady Sabina "I am thankful that you even trust me enough to speak to me about this."

pixel Sabina as Lady Sabina "But I hope you understand when I say... it may be too soon for us to discuss such plans."

pixel Ahlai as <playerName> "But how is it too soon? I am of age, and I've got a lot of experience... so, please, I-"

pixel Sabina as Lady Sabina "I do not <i>doubt</i> that you are capable, <playerName>. You and Seiji have been training under the Order since I took you both in. But there are just too many things lurking in our world right now that even I'm not fully prepared for."

pixel Ahlai as <playerName> "Well, yes..."

pixel Sabina as Lady Sabina "I am truly sorry, dear. But now just isn't the time. I have some suspicions, but we need to find out what's going on before I can let you leave... It's just not safe out there."

pixel Ahlai as <playerName> "I... I understand, Lady Sabina."

pixel Sabina as Lady Sabina "I'm glad you understand, dear."
