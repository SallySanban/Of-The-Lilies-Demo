pixel Myo "Please, <playerName>, just call me Myo. You have no need to stress about why I'm here, I'm just going to claim the potion I ordered a few days ago."

pixel Ahlai as <playerName> "Oh, yes, the Draught of Perpetuity. And you ordered... twelve vials of them!"

pixel Myo "What can I say? I have plenty on my plate-overseeing Agon Province, writing publications and conducting research for the university, teaching students, managing my family's business..."

pixel Myo "I mean, you're going to want to drink these too, or you just wouldn't get anything done, don't you think?"

pixel Ahlai as <playerName> "This potion is not a substitute for proper rest and a good night's sleep, since it only heightens your functionality. It doesn't necessarily relieve any tension or anxiety on your end."

pixel Myo "I'll keep that in mind, <playerName>. Any tension of mine shouldn't be your problem to address, but it must be unfortunate if I've already got you worrying..."

pixel Myo "Lady Sabina mentioned to me how complicated it was to make this draught, and here I requested a dozen!"

pixel Ahlai as <playerName> "Yes... <b>Magic does only come from the gods</b>. But that's what we do here at Sabina's Salves. <b>We craft the potions so ordinary people like us can use the magic too</b>. It's nothing we cannot handle. Please, don't feel too bothered by it."
