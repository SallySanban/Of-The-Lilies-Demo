pixel Manju as Taji "Favorite type of book?"

pixel Manju as Taji "Are you trying to get to know me better, <playerName>?"

pixel Ahlai as <playerName> "Is it really that surprising of a question? You're an archivist. You spend time here."

pixel Ahlai as <playerName> "And I'm just trying to spark some conversation."

pixel Manju as Taji "Hmm... and you're so sure about that, aren't you?"

pixel Manju as Taji "I suppose I prefer reading about magic. I'm interested in how it works, the history behind it, and... the extent of which it can be used."

pixel Ahlai as <playerName> "Well, you said it yourself. Magic has been overused since the beginning. That's why we use potions."

pixel Ahlai as <playerName> "It's just safer that way. But everyone already knows that."

pixel Manju as Taji "Then why don't I ask you this? If Sabina's Salves' potions really kept us safe, then why do the curses continue to happen?"

pixel Manju as Taji "But that wouldn't matter if it really was just a myth, would it? Maybe I've said too much."

pixel Manju as Taji "You've asked me about my favorite type of book. What about yours?"

		pixel Manju as Taji "You have a good eye. What about history, specifically, though? Do you mean a certain time period, or do you mean how history is written, or the history of...?"

		pixel Ahlai as <playerName> "Oh, uh... the history around potions. Not to be so obvious, but that is true."

		pixel Manju as Taji "The legal kinds of potions?"

		pixel Ahlai as <playerName> "...Of course."

	- ...I like magic, too!
		pixel Manju as Taji "...Really?"

		pixel Manju as Taji "Nice try."

		pixel Manju as Taji "I can hear the hesitation in your voice."

		pixel Manju as Taji "I can tell we think differently about magic. You don't need to try so hard."

		pixel Manju as Taji "But the attempt is endearing."
