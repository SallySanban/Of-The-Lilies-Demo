Ahlai as You "<b>Nothing! I don't intend to put you in trouble.</b> But I'm more than ready to help you, believe me."

Laisa "That's a first. Just what would you gain from helping me?"

Ahlai as You "Hmm, just having General Lien seething over your escape is enough of a reward. Call me petty."

Laisa [Smirk] "I'd rather call you smart. I see our hatred for the general is at least one thing we have in common."

Ahlai as You "More than anything. It is exactly his kind, to just... go off and do unforgivable things to the vulnerable, and then call himself a dutiful military man."

Laisa "Well, I'm not too invested in the politics here... but I am hardly surprised, either."

"You would think that the other Seiyslans would share your views. Really, is it so bad for a woman like myself to get the life she deserves?"

Ahlai as You "Which is why you should let me help you. I could shelter you, while your crewmates' whereabouts remain uncertain."

Laisa "That's very tempting, but I can handle things well alone. You wouldn't <i>want</i> to be entangled with a pirate."

"Well, not in the way you're suggesting, anyway."

"You're an interesting one. I'll make sure to come to you if I'm in need of assistance. I'd be grateful for your help."

Ahlai as You "And I am quite pleased by this arrangement. Sure, then. You can call me <playerName>."

Laisa "<playerName>... I'll make sure to remember that."
