		pixel RetiredVeteran as Retired Veteran "Let me see."

		pixel RetiredVeteran as Retired Veteran "Wow..."

		pixel RetiredVeteran as Retired Veteran "This is incredible! It's exactly what I need."

		pixel RetiredVeteran as Retired Veteran "Ah, this is the one I really wanted to see. Look here."

		pixel RetiredVeteran as Retired Veteran "There's this mountain overlooking the Eijiko River. I proposed to my wife on that very mountaintop."

		pixel RetiredVeteran as Retired Veteran "'I climb the peak so that I may adore you in your entirety. O Bisasagi, how your water nourishes me. The sunset welcomes our meeting and I fall for you again like it was my first time gazing upon you.'"

		pixel RetiredVeteran as Retired Veteran "Heh, this poet's good. And that description of hers is how I would describe seeing my wife on that mountaintop."

		pixel RetiredVeteran as Retired Veteran "It was like falling in love with her for the first time again. Proposing to her brought me back to my younger days, when I was afraid to even just talk to her."

		pixel RetiredVeteran as Retired Veteran "She's from Bisasagi, and I'm from Seiysla. I wanted to propose to her at what she thought was the most beautiful spot of her home."

		pixel RetiredVeteran as Retired Veteran "She's gone now. She was tragically killed in a fight."

		pixel RetiredVeteran as Retired Veteran "And remembering her has become... Much more difficult for me."

		pixel Ahlai as <playerName> "I'm so sorry for your loss..."

		pixel RetiredVeteran as Retired Veteran "Thank you."

		pixel RetiredVeteran as Retired Veteran "I've been going to places like this library lately to relive some of my memories of her."

		pixel RetiredVeteran as Retired Veteran "Documents like this... Help me remember."

		pixel RetiredVeteran as Retired Veteran "You aided me with something incredibly personal to me. And for that, I thank you."

		pixel Ahlai as <playerName> "You're welcome."

		pixel Ahlai as <playerName> "It pains me to hear what happened to you... I hope you're able to find peace."
