		Myo at 0 "<playerName>, please-take it from me. Like Tayabac, Agon Province has a few ancestral lands that we try our best to protect, but..."

		Myo at 0 "People like Sir Lien aren't going to change their minds about this. Barely anyone in Seiysla's government will change their minds."

		Ahlai as <playerName> at 1 "And the Seiyslan Empire obviously has its flaws, like anyone can point out..."

		ChangeBodyEmotion(Ahlai -e Right_ApologeticSmile)

		Ahlai as <playerName> at 1 "I really appreciate how clearly you show your concern."

		Ahlai as <playerName> at 1 "But you are right, I can't help but want answers from the General about certain questions I have regarding the Tayabac region. Especially about the invasion."

		ChangeBodyEmotion(Ahlai -e Right_Conflicted)

		Ahlai as <playerName> at 1 "It's just that... given everything, it is a difficult conversation to have. I am not surprised."

		ChangeBodyEmotion(Myo -e Left_Concerned)

		ChangeBodyEmotion(Myo -e Left_Stern)

		ChangeBodyEmotion(Myo -e Left_Annoyed)

		Myo at 0 "Do <i>I</i> have a problem with that? Of course not! Any <i>healthy</i> competition in the Empire is exactly what ensures a balanced way of ruling over it. Or the Empire's provinces, whichever works."

		ChangeBodyEmotion(Myo -e Left_Stern)

		Myo at 0 "However, Sir Lien seems that he isn't one for that healthy dose of discourse. Including perspectives like mine would just get in the way of simply directing orders and having everyone do as he says."

		Ahlai as <playerName> at 1 "Does he really hold that much power in the kingdom? To just... compel people to do as he says?"

		Myo at 0 "Well, yes, but it's not <i>just</i> because he's leading the army. From his parents, to his uncle, to his cousin-thrice-removed, to his cousin-they're <i>all</i> meant to help the Emperor as they rule over the people."

		Myo at 0 "Including us two, believe it or not."

		Myo at 0 "He's also rather inflexible and rigid as a collaborator. I don't bother wasting any more time than I have to, and I recommend you do the same."
