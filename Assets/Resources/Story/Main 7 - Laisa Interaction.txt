		Laisa "I knew I could count on you. "

		Laisa "I need you to make sure what happened between us stays a secret from here on out. Don't let them know where I've gone."

		Ahlai as <playerName> "But, Laisa, I can help you!"

		Laisa "Sure, but I can't let you be involved in this any further."

	- I'm terrible at keeping secrets.
		Ahlai as <playerName> "But I suppose I could pretend that nothing happened..."

		Laisa "Am I that easy to forget?"

		Ahlai as <playerName> "H-Hey, that is not what I meant..."

		Laisa "Oh, I'm kidding. But I cannot hold it against you."

		Laisa "Don't worry about me. I'll be gone before you know it."

	- I can't promise anything.
		Ahlai as <playerName> "Isn't it too risky?"

		Laisa "Ugh, really? Sweetheart, avoiding risk flew right out the window when you helped me out."

		Laisa "Would it not be riskier if you cried out the news to the entire town?"

		Ahlai as <playerName> "Well... uh..."

		Laisa "People don't care about details if the bottomline is that you got entangled with me. So don't let them know where I've gone."

Ahlai as <playerName> "Will... I see you again?"

Laisa "Who knows? If you're as clever as you think you are... then you might just get to find me again."

Laisa "Goodbye, my pearl."
