Seiji "Are you okay, <playerName>? You look distressed..."

Ahlai as You "I'm fine, Seiji. I am fine."

Seiji "Are you sure? You can tell me, you know."

Ahlai as You "Instead of having me tell you, you can <i>look</i> at this article, Seiji."

Ahlai as You "That damn bastard, speaking as if he hasn't done any worse than a pirate!"

"The Empire has taken more wealth from its victims in years, more than anything she'll ever plunder for her whole life."

"Yet he expects us to praise him as this hero of Seiysla?! He has no shame!"

Seiji [Worry] "<playerName>, please calm down! What if someone hears you? <playerName>?"

Ahlai as You "..."

Seiji "...Oh, I... I am so sorry..."

Ahlai as You "No, I should apologize. I'm sorry for snapping, for taking it out on you. I just... I cannot forget it. What he and the Seiyslan Empire did to my people. I can never forget it."

"He is responsible for our suffering, how many lives were lost, and for how I lost my home. I lost my family because of him, Seiji. It's hard not to let any anger just consume me."

Seiji "No, please. I understand. I at least can see why it's difficult, being away from your family for so long."

Ahlai as You " It is. I do not know where they are, or if any of them are even alive and safe. If it weren't for Lien's expansion plans for the Empire..."

"We would still be together in Tayabac, peacefully."

"All I would have to worry about is whether I was fit to be the next chieftain."

"But that future was taken away from me, along with everything else. I can never forget it, and neither will I forgive him for it."

Seiji "It's only reasonable, okay? You'll be okay. I just want you to know that you're not alone, and I also don't want you to just... hold on to that hurt forever."

"Lady Sabina and I, and whoever else is lucky enough to meet you... we'll always be there."

Ahlai as You "Thank you, Seiji. I really mean it. I suppose there are times where I wonder if I can find my family, however."

"If they're still out there. Of course it will take a lot of time, but to leave Kuchai Town and find them... it would help to know if they're safe after all."

Seiji [Thought] "Then... maybe we can convince Lady Sabina to let us go on a journey, just the two of us!"

"It's not as if we're still the same kids that she took in 10 years ago. You can look for your family, and I'll be there to help you. Be your second set of eyes, yeah?"
