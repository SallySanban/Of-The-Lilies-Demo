pixel Ahlai as <playerName> "Heh, I wish."

pixel Ahlai as <playerName> "That would've been more pleasant than what I actually got."

pixel Seiji "Oh..."

pixel Ahlai as <playerName> "The memory... It's just so painful..."

pixel Ahlai as <playerName> "I don't think I can ever get the invasion out of my head..."

pixel Seiji "I'm so sorry, <playerName>. I shouldn't have asked."

pixel Ahlai as <playerName> "No, it's okay. You were just checking up on me."

pixel Seiji "Still... I know this isn't something pleasant for you to talk about."

pixel Ahlai as <playerName> "You're always so considerate of me. Thank you, Seiji."

pixel Seiji "I-it's no problem. I'm always here for you, <playerName>."
