pixel Sabina as Lady Sabina "The curses can only be stopped with the <b>Ritual of Respite</b>."

pixel Sabina as Lady Sabina "It is obviously an advanced magical ritual, but we still require gathering the necessary components the way we would for making, say, a potion or a salve."

Ahlai as <playerName> at 0 "What kinds of components?"

pixel Sabina as Lady Sabina "To complete the ritual, you will need to seek out a sacred <b>dagger</b>, and <b>one of the gods' ancient artifacts</b>."

pixel Sabina as Lady Sabina "They have been lost to time, but they surely lie beyond Kuchai's borders."

pixel Sabina as Lady Sabina "You will need to prepare for a journey. This is what you've been training for."
