Ahlai as You "<b>You don't have to worry about that.</b> I'll keep my mouth shut if it means we wipe that horrid look of arrogance off of Lien's face."

Laisa "You're not a fan of the general either, huh?"

Ahlai as You "Of course not. I saw how cruel he can be with my own eyes."

Laisa "Cruel in what sense?"

Ahlai as You "The Seiyslan Empire went off on its usual campaigns to seize more lands and gold for itself."

"Seiyslan soldiers thought it would be lovely to just burn down our houses, kill our people, and just... well, you understand."

Laisa "How terrible. Makes me look like a harmless crook, doesn't he?"

Ahlai as You "Exactly. I don't have any intentions to put your life in the hands of that cruel general. Believe me, I'm here to help if you wish."

Laisa "I don't doubt you. But I don't think it's wise for you to get tangled with the likes of me."

Ahlai as You "So you think I'm too fragile for danger?"

Laisa "I only think you're too precious for all this trouble. You're the only one whose first instinct wasn't to run from me. That's something, don't you think?"

Ahlai as You "What do you mean, then? If you still don't want my help, I'll be on my way. But if you need somewhere new to hide, I might know a place."
