Sabina as Lady Sabina "You made it."

Ahlai as You "I haven't been back here since I took the oath to the Order of La Liryo... What is it that you wanted to talk about, Lady?"

Sabina as Lady Sabina "Do you know how magic works, <playerName>?"

Ahlai as You "Yes. It was given to us by the gods, and can be used through the potions that we make."

Sabina as Lady Sabina "There's a little more to it than that."

"The gods are fond of nature. This is why I speculated the curses manifest itself in the form of calamities."

"When they bestowed upon us their magic, they did so in the form of <b>essence</b>."

"This is the energy that is only present in nature. Plants, animals, and even... people."

Ahlai as You "So people have essence, yes, and...?"

Sabina as Lady Sabina "Yes, indeed. The potions that we brew are designed to harness this essence, allowing people to use it to produce magic."

"Some people may have more essence than others, making them more receptive to magic. Seiji is one of these people."

Ahlai as You "He is? Is he aware of this?"

Sabina as Lady Sabina "No. I found out when he was a young age, but I chose not to tell him to keep him safe."

"And I trust you'll keep this information from him as well."

Ahlai as You "Why does this even have to be a secret? Doesn't Seiji... we all trust him here, don't we?"

Sabina as Lady Sabina "When I told you both about the Ritual of Respite, I left out the most critical component needed to perform the ritual."

Sabina as Lady Sabina [Worry] "I didn't want to tell you in front of Seiji... he has a good heart."

Sabina as Lady Sabina [Stern] "But you will need to make a choice.{a} <b>The ritual requires a single sacrifice to be made as an offering.</b>"

"And given the amount of essence he possesses...{a} <b>he is one of the most suitable candidates.</b>"

Ahlai as You "Seiji? As a... sacrifice?"

Sabina as Lady Sabina "There are a few you can choose from, <playerName>. The choice is there for you to take. But think very, very hard about what you want, knowing all you've been through."

"With what I know...{a} and with what the Ritual of Respite demands of us..."

"Ultimately, you can only <b>choose one.</b>"
