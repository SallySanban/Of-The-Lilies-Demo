Seiji at 0 "Oh, <playerName>, you're finally out. What took you so long?"

Ahlai as <playerName> at 1 "Lady Sabina wanted three flasks of areka, right? The order took a while."

Seiji at 0 "Is there something wrong...?"

Ahlai as <playerName> at 1 "What makes you say that?"

Seiji at 0 "I can see it in your face, <playerName>. I know you. What happened?"

Ahlai as <playerName> at 1 "I had a chat with Sir Aciano. And... General Lien."

Seiji at 0 "General Lien?! I saw him enter, but I thought you'd be out soon. I didn't expect you to take this long to get those drinks..."

Seiji at 0 "Did he do anything to you? Did he hurt you, anything? Ugh, I knew I should've come in with you..."

Ahlai as <playerName> at 1 "No, we just talked. I wanted to ask him for clues about where my family could be... but I didn't get much information."

Ahlai as <playerName> at 1 "All I know is, I can't stop my search here in Kuchai Town."

Ahlai as <playerName> at 1 "There are lots of places I could look. I could even start in Agon Province, with the help of Sir Aciano..."

Seiji at 0 "You want to leave... Kuchai Town?"

Ahlai as <playerName> at 1 "It's just something I've been thinking about. I don't even know if they're still alive... but they were taken away right in front of my eyes."

Ahlai as <playerName> at 1 "And I've lived for 10 years not knowing if they're okay or not."

Ahlai as <playerName> at 1 "I'm sorry, Seiji. But it's my family..."

Ahlai as <playerName> at 1 "I know that I should be focusing on my duties at the Order of La Liryo."

Ahlai as <playerName> at 1 "And chasing after ghosts isn't my priority. It shouldn't be."

Ahlai as <playerName> at 1 "But, I just wish I could move forward..."

Seiji at 0 "I mean... well... you are, right? Or..."

Ahlai as <playerName> at 1 "Tough question..."

Seiji at 0 "Hey, you want to find your family. I can at least understand that."

ChangeBodyEmotion(Seiji -e Left_Worried)

Seiji at 0 "I mean, it would drive anyone crazy not being able to do anything about it. Or maybe there is something you could do?"

ChangeBodyEmotion(Seiji -e Left_ApologeticSmile)

Seiji at 0 "How about we ask Lady Sabina if we could go together?"

ChangeBodyEmotion(Ahlai -e Right_Sad)

Ahlai as <playerName> at 1 "What do you mean?"

Seiji at 0 "We can leave Kuchai Town together. You could look for your family, and I could be there to help you. What do you think?"

		Seiji at 0 "Then that's just even more of a reason for me to come with you. Just try to ask her, <playerName>."

		Seiji at 0 "I know that Lady Sabina would want to do what she can to ease your worries."

		ChangeBodyEmotion(Ahlai -e Right_ApologeticSmile)

		Ahlai as <playerName> at 1 "...You're right, Seiji."

		Seiji at 0 "Let's head back. She might be worried that we've been out so late. We can ask her then."

	- That could work...

		Ahlai as <playerName> at 1 "I just feel like I should go with someone with more influence. Like Sir Aciano. He's also been places, so I imagine he would know his way around."

		Seiji at 0 "Oh... I understand."

		Ahlai as <playerName> at 1 "And, would Lady Sabina really let me go? She's always been protective of me, and we are her employees, in any case..."

		ChangeBodyEmotion(Seiji -e Left_SadSmile)

		Seiji at 0 "I'll help you convince her. I know this is important to you, <playerName>."

		Ahlai as <playerName> at 1 "Thank you, Seiji."

		Seiji at 0 "Let's head back. She might be worried that we've been out so late."
