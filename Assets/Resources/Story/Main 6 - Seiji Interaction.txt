pixel Seiji "Oh, <playerName>, you're finally out. What took you so long?"

pixel Ahlai as <playerName> "Lady Sabina wanted three flasks of areka, right? The order took a while."

pixel Seiji "Is there something wrong...?"

pixel Ahlai as <playerName> "What makes you say that?"

pixel Seiji "I can see it in your face, <playerName>. I know you. What happened?"

pixel Ahlai as <playerName> "I had a chat with Sir Aciano. And... General Lien."

pixel Seiji "General Lien?! I saw him enter, but I thought you'd be out soon. I didn't expect you to take this long to get those drinks..."

pixel Seiji "Did he do anything to you? Did he hurt you, anything? Ugh, I knew I should've come in with you..."

pixel Ahlai as <playerName> "No, we just talked. I wanted to ask him for clues about where my family could be... but I didn't get much information."

pixel Ahlai as <playerName> "All I know is, I can't stop my search here in Kuchai Town."

pixel Ahlai as <playerName> "There are lots of places I could look. I could even start in Agon Province, with the help of Sir Aciano..."

pixel Seiji "You want to leave... Kuchai Town?"

pixel Ahlai as <playerName> "It's just something I've been thinking about. I don't even know if they're still alive... but they were taken away right in front of my eyes."

pixel Ahlai as <playerName> "And I've lived for 10 years not knowing if they're okay or not."

pixel Ahlai as <playerName> "I'm sorry, Seiji. But it's my family..."

pixel Ahlai as <playerName> "I know that I should be focusing on my duties at the Order of La Liryo."

pixel Ahlai as <playerName> "And chasing after ghosts isn't my priority. It shouldn't be."

pixel Ahlai as <playerName> "But, I just wish I could move forward..."

pixel Seiji "I mean... well... you are, right? Or..."

pixel Ahlai as <playerName> "Tough question..."

pixel Seiji "Hey, you want to find your family. I can at least understand that."

pixel Seiji "I mean, it would drive anyone crazy not being able to do anything about it. Or maybe there is something you could do?"

pixel Seiji "How about we ask Lady Sabina if we could go together?"

pixel Ahlai as <playerName> "What do you mean?"

pixel Seiji "We can leave Kuchai Town together. You could look for your family, and I could be there to help you. What do you think?"

		pixel Seiji "Then that's just even more of a reason for me to come with you. Just try to ask her, <playerName>."

		pixel Seiji "I know that Lady Sabina would want to do what she can to ease your worries."

		pixel Ahlai as <playerName> "...You're right, Seiji."

		pixel Seiji "Let's head back. She might be worried that we've been out so late. We can ask her then."

	- That could work...
		$SeijiHesitation = true

		pixel Seiji "You sound hesitant... What's the matter?"

		pixel Ahlai as <playerName> "I just feel like I should go with someone with more influence. Like Sir Aciano. He's also been places, so I imagine he would know his way around."

		pixel Seiji "Oh... I understand."

		pixel Ahlai as <playerName> "And, would Lady Sabina really let me go? She's always been protective of me, and we are her employees, in any case..."

		pixel Seiji "I'll help you convince her. I know this is important to you, <playerName>."

		pixel Ahlai as <playerName> "Thank you, Seiji."

		pixel Seiji "Let's head back. She might be worried that we've been out so late."
