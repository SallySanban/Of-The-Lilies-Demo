pixel Seiji "Hey..."

pixel Seiji "Do you want to talk about your nightmare?"

pixel Seiji "I know it's a sensitive topic but... I just think it'll lift that weight on your chest a little."

pixel Ahlai as <playerName> "It starts off nice. I see my family, warm smiles across their faces."

pixel Ahlai as <playerName> "They laugh, they banter. My father sends me off to do chores and I meet the rest of my village."

pixel Ahlai as <playerName> "My father tells me to join him at the cliff overlooking our beautiful village."

pixel Ahlai as <playerName> "I go there and... he's not there."

pixel Ahlai as <playerName> "And the only thing I see up there... is my village in flames."

pixel Seiji "..."

pixel Ahlai as <playerName> "I run down as fast as I can, but I see people screaming and dying everywhere I look."

pixel Ahlai as <playerName> "And that's when I see him: <b>Lien</b>."

pixel Ahlai as <playerName> "He led the invasion..."

pixel Ahlai as <playerName> "I fight him with everything I have, but it's not enough."

pixel Ahlai as <playerName> "I'm knocked down to the ground and the last thing I see is his cruel smile..."

pixel Ahlai as <playerName> "His smile, which has cemented its place in my mind as a lingering ghost..."

pixel Seiji "<playerName>... I'm so sorry to hear about that..."

pixel Seiji "If I could do anything to help you with your sleep, I would."

pixel Ahlai as <playerName> "Thanks, Seiji..."

pixel Seiji "..."

pixel Seiji "Would you... like a hug?"

pixel Ahlai as <playerName> "What?"

pixel Seiji "I think a nightmare like that deserves a hug."

pixel Seiji "Do you want one?"
