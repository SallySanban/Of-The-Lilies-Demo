	- Is the tavern usually this crowded?
		pixel Barkeep "Well, yes. Being the only tavern in town does that."

	- Does Lady Sabina go here often?
		pixel Barkeep "She does. She's a nice woman."

		pixel Barkeep "If you happen to be working for her, tell her I say hello. And that her usual is always ready for her. I owe her, anyway."

		Load("Main 5 - Barkeep Repeating Dialogue")

	- Did you know that Lien and the army are here?
		pixel Barkeep "Hmph. I don't care about him. Probably corrupt like everyone else. I don't plan to give him any more shit than he orders."

		pixel Ahlai as <playerName> "I understand, but... may I ask why?"

		pixel Barkeep "Same as anyone who doesn't care, really."

		pixel Barkeep "He won't even be in town for long. Whatever. If he brings in more customers, that's fine by me."

		Load("Main 5 - Barkeep Repeating Dialogue")

	- Isn't that the Governor-General over there?
		pixel Barkeep "Ah, Myo, right?"
		
		pixel Barkeep "He's a good man. Annoying sometimes with all the politics."

		pixel Barkeep "But I guess that <i>is</i> his job. So he's welcome here any time."

		pixel Barkeep "I'm also proud to say he keeps a large tab. Great for business."

		Load("Main 5 - Barkeep Repeating Dialogue")

	- That's all
		pixel Barkeep "Oh, good. I can't spend my whole shift yapping with you."

		pixel Barkeep "I won't get to do your order if you keep talking to me."

		pixel Barkeep "There are plenty of people in here. Shouldn't be that hard to find someone to talk to."
