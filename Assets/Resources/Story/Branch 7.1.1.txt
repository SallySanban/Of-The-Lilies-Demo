Manju as ??? "You two have been talking for quite some time now. I hope there isn't too much of an issue, for tavern patrons to simply acquaint themselves with each other?"

Ahlai as You "It is hardly an issue. <b>I go by <playerName>.</b>"

Manju as Taji "If I may call you <playerName>, then you may call me Taji. <playerName>... the name alone has me interested."

Ahlai as You "Why, 'cause the name is pretty?"

Manju as Taji "You flatter yourself. Though, yes, names do tell me stories-who they are, where they're from-and yours is no exception."

Ahlai as You "...Where I'm from, huh..."

Manju as Taji "...If you'll excuse me, then, <playerName>. I do have to be somewhere after all, so you should go enjoy your drinks in the tavern with that companion of yours. Take care."
