		Ahlai as <playerName> at 0 "Is this how you treat every visitor at the library?"

		Manju as ??? at 1 "The truth would leave me without a job, but I would be leaving you without a book if that is all the information you have on hand."

		Ahlai as <playerName> at 0 "The receptionist spoke very highly of all the archivists here, so if I'm just left empty-handed, that would simply be... so unfortunate!"

		Manju as ??? at 1 "You-! You plan to speak with my boss about this?"

		Ahlai as <playerName> at 0 "Only if you don't get me that book."

		Manju as ??? at 1 "Damn, alright... ugh, how about we just start with the Magic section?"

		Ahlai as <playerName> at 0 "Good."

		Ahlai as <playerName> at 0 "To be candid, you sound displeased that I couldn't be more specific. I apologize, but this really is all the information I have on hand. Any book will do, please."

		Manju as ??? at 1 "...Was my displeasure that obvious?"

		Ahlai as <playerName> at 0 "Hmm..."

		Ahlai as <playerName> at 0 "I could also just have a knack for reading people, don't you think?"

		Manju as ??? at 1 "More the type to read people than to read books, then?"

		Manju as ??? at 1 "I suppose both are handy skills to have."

		Ahlai as <playerName> at 0 "And what about you, then? If you don't mind me asking?"

		Manju as ??? at 1 "You said it yourself, you have a knack for reading people. Come up with your own conclusions."

		Ahlai as <playerName> at 0 "<i>When you put it like that, then...</i>"

		Manju as ??? at 1 "Hold on... I think I found what you're looking for."

Ahlai as <playerName> at 0 "Yes, it's this one!"

Manju as ??? at 1 "You seem relieved to find that book. Though, it isn't a myth."

Ahlai as <playerName> at 0 "Oh, really? How would you know? You couldn't have possibly been around during the last one."

ChangeBodyEmotion(Manju -e Right_Chuckle)

ChangeBodyEmotion(Manju -e Right_SlightSmile)

Ahlai as <playerName> at 0 "I suppose not."

Manju as ??? at 1 "That makes two of us, then. So... you plan to tell me any more about how this is all just a myth?"

ChangeBodyEmotion(Ahlai -b Left_Question_Body -e Left_Question)

Ahlai as <playerName> at 0 "Then what makes you so sure that it isn't a myth?"

Manju as ??? at 1 "I've been walking around recently. Kuchai Town is a bit different from how it was several weeks ago."

Manju as ??? at 1 "Almost like the gods are giving us a sign that the curses are returning."

Ahlai as <playerName> at 0 "Do the gods have anything to do with it?"

ChangeBodyEmotion(Manju -e Right_StraightThreatening)

Manju as ??? at 1 "Maybe they do. The <b>overuse of magic has been a problem ever since it was given to us by the gods</b>."

Manju as ??? at 1 "Isn't that what causes it?"

ChangeBodyEmotion(Manju -e Right_SmileEyesClosed)

Manju as ??? at 1 "At least, that's what it says in the book you wanted to borrow. Here."

ChangeBodyEmotion(Manju -e Right_SlightSmile)

Manju as ??? at 1 "You should have noticed some changes, too. I see you around town. You work at Sabina's Salves, correct?"

Manju as ??? at 1 "You're always carrying potions around. You and that friend of yours."

Ahlai as <playerName> at 0 "I do. And his name is Seiji. We mostly make potion deliveries to our clients."

Manju as ??? at 1 "Your potion requests have increased in number, haven't they? Why do you think that's so?"

Ahlai as <playerName> at 0 "Well, I..."

ChangeBodyEmotion(Ahlai -b Left_Default_Body -e Left_Suspicious)

Ahlai as <playerName> at 0 "How would you... know that?"

ChangeBodyEmotion(Manju -e Right_SmileScaryEyes)

Manju as ??? at 1 "Oh, I just notice things."

Manju as ??? at 1 "More and more unfortunate incidents have been happening around town, so I figured more people would need help from the potions in your shop."

ChangeBodyEmotion(Manju -e Right_SmileEyesClosed)

Manju as ??? at 1 "Lucky guess?"

Ahlai as <playerName> at 0 "For someone who spends his day indoors, you're pretty observant."

Ahlai as <playerName> at 0 "It's nice to meet you... I'm <playerName>."

Manju as Taji at 1 "<playerName>... The name alone has me interested."

ChangeBodyEmotion(Ahlai -b Left_Question_Body -e Left_Question)

Ahlai as <playerName> at 0 "Why, 'cause it's pretty?"

ChangeBodyEmotion(Manju -e Right_SmileEyesClosed)

Manju as Taji at 1 "You flatter yourself. But names do tell me stories - who they are, where they're from - yours is no exception."
