pixel Ahlai as <playerName> "I'm looking for a book on a 100-year curse. You know, that myth? Do you happen to know where it is?"

pixel Manju as ??? "Well, I <i>would</i> know where it is, if you <i>could</i> be more specific. A lot of books here cover curses that last a hundred years."

pixel Ahlai as <playerName> "<i>What's his problem?</i>"

		pixel Ahlai as <playerName> "Is this how you treat every visitor at the library?"

		pixel Manju as ??? "The truth would leave me without a job, but I would be leaving you without a book if that is all the information you have on hand."

		pixel Ahlai as <playerName> "The receptionist spoke very highly of all the archivists here, so if I'm just left empty-handed, that would simply be... so unfortunate!"

		pixel Manju as ??? "You-! You plan to speak with my boss about this?"

		pixel Ahlai as <playerName> "Only if you don't get me that book."

		pixel Manju as ??? "Damn, alright... ugh, how about we just start with the Magic section?"

		pixel Ahlai as <playerName> "Good."

		pixel Ahlai as <playerName> "<i>He's stopped talking and his expression's unreadable again. He seems to have gotten the message, though, with how much faster he's working.</i>"

		pixel Manju as ??? "Perhaps there's a title you can recall...?"

	- What do you mean?

		pixel Ahlai as <playerName> "To be candid, you sound displeased that I couldn't be more specific. I apologize, but this really is all the information I have on hand. Any book will do, please."

		pixel Manju as ??? "...Was my displeasure that obvious?"

		pixel Ahlai as <playerName> "Hmm..."

		pixel Ahlai as <playerName> "I could also just have a knack for reading people, don't you think?"

		pixel Manju as ??? "More the type to read people than to read books, then?"

		pixel Manju as ??? "I suppose both are handy skills to have."

		pixel Ahlai as <playerName> "And what about you, then? If you don't mind me asking?"

		pixel Manju as ??? "You said it yourself, you have a knack for reading people. Come up with your own conclusions."

		pixel Ahlai as <playerName> "<i>When you put it like that, then...</i>"

		pixel Manju as ??? "Hold on... I think I found what you're looking for."

pixel Ahlai as <playerName> "I believe the book is called-"

pixel Manju as ??? "<i>Seiysla's 100-Year Curse?</i>"

pixel Ahlai as <playerName> "<i>Seiysla's 100-Year Curse,</i> yes."

pixel Manju as ??? "Is it... this one?"

pixel Ahlai as <playerName> "Yes, it's this one!"

pixel Manju as ??? "You seem relieved to find that book. Though, it isn't a myth."

pixel Ahlai as <playerName> "Oh, really? How would you know? You couldn't have possibly been around during the last one."

pixel Manju as ??? "Well, were <i>you</i> around during the last one? They only happen once in a hundred years, you know."

pixel Ahlai as <playerName> "I suppose not."

pixel Manju as ??? "That makes two of us, then. So... you plan to tell me any more about how this is all just a myth?"

pixel Ahlai as <playerName> "Then what makes you so sure that it isn't a myth?"

pixel Manju as ??? "I've been walking around recently. Kuchai Town is a bit different from how it was several weeks ago. Almost like the gods are giving us a sign that the curses are returning."

pixel Ahlai as <playerName> "Do the gods have anything to do with it?"

pixel Manju as ??? "Maybe they do. The <b>overuse of magic has been a problem ever since it was given to us by the gods</b>."

pixel Manju as ??? "Isn't that what causes it?"

pixel Manju as ??? "At least, that's what it says in the book you wanted to borrow. Here."

pixel Manju as ??? "You should have noticed some changes, too. I see you around town. You work at Sabina's Salves, correct? You're always carrying potions around. You and that friend of yours."

pixel Ahlai as <playerName> "I do. And his name is Seiji. We mostly make potion deliveries to our clients."

pixel Manju as ??? "Your potion requests have increased in number, haven't they? Why do you think that's so?"

pixel Ahlai as <playerName> "Well, I..."

pixel Ahlai as <playerName> "How would you... know that?"

pixel Manju as ??? "Oh, I just notice things. More and more unfortunate incidents have been happening around town, so I figured more people would need help from the potions in your shop."

pixel Manju as ??? "Lucky guess?"

pixel Ahlai as <playerName> "For someone who spends his day indoors, you're pretty observant."

pixel Manju as ??? "You just seem to catch my eye."

pixel Ahlai as <playerName> "Oh, well... I didn't get your name."

pixel Manju as Taji "It's Taji."

pixel Ahlai as <playerName> "It's nice to meet you... I'm <playerName>."

pixel Manju as Taji "<playerName>... The name alone has me interested."

pixel Ahlai as <playerName> "Why, 'cause it's pretty?"

pixel Manju as Taji "You flatter yourself. But names do tell me stories - who they are, where they're from - yours is no exception."
