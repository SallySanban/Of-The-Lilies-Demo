pixel Seiji "Oh. Something very absurd happened earlier while you were still sleeping!"

pixel Ahlai as <playerName> "What happened?"

pixel Seiji "Just before we opened, as Lady Sabina and I were readying the shop, suddenly, this random lady barged in."

pixel Seiji "She walked in as if we were already open."

pixel Seiji "Lady Sabina was somewhere else so I had to be the one to tell her that we weren't open yet."

pixel Seiji "She goes, 'Oh, but you'll be open in a few minutes, yes? This is utterly urgent, I just need to make a quick purchase.'"

pixel Seiji "And before I could even say anything, she just started grabbing potions straight from the unpacked boxes!"

pixel Ahlai as <playerName> "What?!"

pixel Seiji "Those potions weren't even for sale. They were for me to take to the back."

pixel Seiji "So she takes them to the counter to pay and I tell her just that. She kept insisting and I kept protesting."

pixel Seiji "The next thing I know, she starts screaming at me! Calling me names, saying I'm rude and unprofessional, and that I shouldn't be working here..."

pixel Seiji "She demanded to talk to Lady Sabina and, right on cue, she came in, probably hearing her nagging from across the hall."

pixel Seiji "You should've seen what happened next! That crazy lady actually thought Lady Sabina would side with her."

pixel Seiji "But instead, she got a verbal beatdown from her! I'm sure her ego totally dropped by the time Lady Sabina was done."

pixel Seiji "In the end, she left, saying she's never coming back."

pixel Seiji "Haha! It's safe to say that she's banned from even coming inside now."

		pixel Ahlai as <playerName> "That woman was crazy and you are not any of the things she accused you of being."

		pixel Ahlai as <playerName> "Don't let that woman or that experience put you down."

		pixel Seiji "Thanks, <playerName>. I appreciate it."

		pixel Seiji "I know that lady was speaking nonsense, and Lady Sabina backed me up."

		pixel Seiji "It's still nice to hear that validation from you though, <playerName>."

		pixel Ahlai as <playerName> "You're a good guy, Seiji. Never forget that."

		pixel Seiji "I know. Thanks, <playerName>."

		pixel Seiji "So long as you believe that, I'll believe it too."

	- Don't mess with Lady Sabina.
		pixel Seiji "Agreed. That woman can be absolutely terrifying."

		pixel Ahlai as <playerName> "It's a good thing she was there to protect you."

		pixel Ahlai as <playerName> "I imagine it wouldn't have turned out as well without her."

		pixel Seiji "I'm not defenseless, you know. I can stand up for myself."

		pixel Seiji "But that crazy lady probably wouldn't have taken me as seriously as Lady Sabina. It was a good thing she was there."
