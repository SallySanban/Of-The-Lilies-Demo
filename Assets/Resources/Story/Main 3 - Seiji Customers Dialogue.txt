Seiji at 1 "Oh. Something very absurd happened earlier while you were still sleeping!"

Ahlai as <playerName> at 0 "What happened?"

Seiji at 1 "Just before we opened, as Lady Sabina and I were readying the shop, suddenly, this random lady barged in."

Seiji at 1 "She walked in as if we were already open."

Seiji at 1 "Lady Sabina was somewhere else so I had to be the one to tell her that we weren't open yet."

Seiji at 1 "She goes, 'Oh, but you'll be open in a few minutes, yes? This is utterly urgent, I just need to make a quick purchase.'"

Seiji at 1 "And before I could even say anything, she just started grabbing potions straight from the unpacked boxes!"

ChangeBodyEmotion(Ahlai -b Left_Default_Body -e Left_Surprised)

Ahlai as <playerName> at 0 "What?!"

Seiji at 1 "Those potions weren't even for sale. They were for me to take to the back."

Seiji at 1 "So she takes them to the counter to pay and I tell her just that. She kept insisting and I kept protesting."

Seiji at 1 "The next thing I know, she starts screaming at me! Calling me names, saying I'm rude and unprofessional, and that I shouldn't be working here..."

Seiji at 1 "She demanded to talk to Lady Sabina and, right on cue, she came in, probably hearing her nagging from across the hall."

Seiji at 1 "You should've seen what happened next! That crazy lady actually thought Lady Sabina would side with her."

Seiji at 1 "But instead, she got a verbal beatdown from her! I'm sure her ego totally dropped by the time Lady Sabina was done."

Seiji at 1 "In the end, she left, saying she's never coming back."

Seiji at 1 "Haha! It's safe to say that she's banned from even coming inside now."
