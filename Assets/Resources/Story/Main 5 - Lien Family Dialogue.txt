		Ahlai as <playerName> at 0 "<i>Last I remember, Dad was shipped off to the Logresh Empire...</i>"

		ChangeBodyEmotion(Ahlai -e Left_Pursed)

		Ahlai as <playerName> at 0 "I've been looking for any records on the Logresh Empire. Given how naturally <i>skilled</i> you are, what resources did you use to study up on topics like... the people that could be there?"

		Lien as General Lien at 1 "Are you searching for someone?"

		Lien as General Lien at 1 "If you would like to know more about the Logresh Empire, the library is always a good place to start. I'm afraid any records detailing the key figures in that Empire are classified."

		ChangeBodyEmotion(Ahlai -e Left_Conflicted)

		Ahlai as <playerName> at 0 "Of course..."

		Ahlai as <playerName> at 0 "<i>I've already searched the library over the past 10 years...</i>"

	- Ask about Mom
		ChangeBodyEmotion(Ahlai -b Left_Default_Body -e Left_Conflicted)

		Ahlai as <playerName> at 0 "<i>Last I remember, they said they were taking Mom somewhere in the land of Haripura. I hope she's doing alright, but...</i>"

		ChangeBodyEmotion(Ahlai -e Left_Pursed)

		Ahlai as <playerName> at 0 "Might I ask, do you know anything about Haripura?"

		Lien as General Lien at 1 "...What about Haripura?"

		Ahlai as <playerName> at 0 "I have been... thinking of going on a journey. How do you suppose I could get there?"

		Lien as General Lien at 1 "If you head south from Kuchai Town... it's not impossible to reach Haripura. But I recommend that you prepare for this trip with, say, your employer."

		Lien as General Lien at 1 "They have been taking in more foreigners, lately. So you could be welcomed, whether for a visit or otherwise."

	- Ask about Dalawi
		ChangeBodyEmotion(Ahlai -b Left_Default_Body -e Left_Conflicted)

		Ahlai as <playerName> at 0 "<i>Last I remember, Dalawi was taken away to another empire. I think it was the Gataran Empire...</i>"

		ChangeBodyEmotion(Ahlai -e Left_Pursed)

		Ahlai as <playerName> at 0 "With all this news about pirates from the Gataran Empire... forgive the question, but is Ilaisaane the only pirate at large?"

		Lien as General Lien at 1 "Certainly not. We still have yet to find the rest of her crew."

		Lien as General Lien at 1 "But if you want my opinion, the Gataran Empire should put in more effort in addressing how their pirates cause entire messes in our lands."

		Lien as General Lien at 1 "And knowing that we <i>have</i> Ilaisaane, well... I suppose you understand my stance on the Gataran Empire."

		Ahlai as <playerName> at 0 "Do you think the pirates report back to them?"

		Lien as General Lien at 1 "I am certain at least some of them do. For the pirate woman, I won't divulge."

		Lien as General Lien at 1 "But please, if you travel, do so in a legal manner."

	- Ask about Laya
		ChangeBodyEmotion(Ahlai -b Left_Default_Body -e Left_Conflicted)

		Ahlai as <playerName> at 0 "<i>I remember they mentioned the mines... Laya was taken there. But there are so many mines-which one could I start with?</i>"

		ChangeBodyEmotion(Ahlai -e Left_Pursed)

		Ahlai as <playerName> at 0 "Say, who could I speak to when it comes to the mines in Ihraye?"

		Ahlai as <playerName> at 0 "Well, Agon Province has several mineral deposits near its borders. Along with its neighboring territories. That’s likely the best place you could gather. Do you run a business for this sort of work?"

		ChangeBodyEmotion(Ahlai -e Left_Sheepish)

		Ahlai as <playerName> at 0 "Thank you! Well, no. But I have been thinking about it."

		Lien as General Lien at 1 "Hmm. Good luck on your endeavors, then."

		ChangeBodyEmotion(Ahlai -e Left_Smirk)

		Ahlai as <playerName> at 0 "Oh, you make it sound like a challenge."

		ChangeBodyEmotion(Lien -e Right_Smile)

		Lien as General Lien at 1 "Only if you <i>really</i> want it to be."

	- Ask about Alonay
		ChangeBodyEmotion(Ahlai -b Left_Default_Body -e Left_Conflicted)

		Ahlai as <playerName> at 0 "<i>I don't even know where they took Alonay... where would I start?</i>"

		ChangeBodyEmotion(Ahlai -e Left_Pursed)

		Ahlai as <playerName> at 0 "If I were looking for someone... where should I begin?"

		Lien as General Lien at 1 "That would depend on who you are looking for. I suggest you bring this up with the local authorities here in Kuchai Town."

		ChangeBodyEmotion(Ahlai -e Left_Conflicted)

		Ahlai as <playerName> at 0 "Are there more... dangerous parts of the continent, then? That I might end up going to?"

		Lien as General Lien at 1 "That would also depend, but I believe you could prepare yourself for that."

		Ahlai as <playerName> at 0 "<i>I've already looked all over town. I'm at least sure that Alonay isn't here.</i>"

		Ahlai as <playerName> at 0 "<i>And if the Seiyslan authorities are anything like Lien... what help could I get from them, anyway?</i>"

	- Ask about Liwani
		ChangeBodyEmotion(Ahlai -b Left_Default_Body -e Left_Pursed)

		Ahlai as <playerName> at 0 "If I were to look for, say, orphaned infants or children, where could I look?"

		Lien as General Lien at 1 "...I apologize, I wouldn't know. You may want to speak with someone in the town hall."

		ChangeBodyEmotion(Ahlai -e Left_Conflicted)

		Ahlai as <playerName> at 0 "Oh..."

	- Nevermind...
		ChangeBodyEmotion(Ahlai -b Left_Default_Body -e Left_Conflicted)

		Ahlai as <playerName> at 0 "<i>If I ask him about my family... What if he remembers me from before?</i>"

		Ahlai as <playerName> at 0 "On second thought, nevermind..."
