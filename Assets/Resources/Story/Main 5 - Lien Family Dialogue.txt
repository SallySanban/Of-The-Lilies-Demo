{
	- Ask about Dad
		pixel Ahlai as <playerName> "<i>Last I remember, Dad was shipped off to the Logresh Empire...</i>"

		pixel Ahlai as <playerName> "I've been looking for any records on the Logresh Empire. Given how naturally <i>skilled</i> you are, what resources did you use to study up on topics like... the people that could be there?"

		pixel Lien as General Lien "Are you searching for someone?"

		pixel Lien as General Lien "If you would like to know more about the Logresh Empire, the library is always a good place to start. I'm afraid any records detailing the key figures in that Empire are classified."

		pixel Ahlai as <playerName> "Of course..."

		pixel Ahlai as <playerName> "<i>I've already searched the library over the past 10 years...</i>"

	- Ask about Mom
		pixel Ahlai as <playerName> "<i>Last I remember, they said they were taking Mom somewhere in the land of Haripura. I hope she's doing alright, but...</i>"

		pixel Ahlai as <playerName> "Might I ask, do you know anything about Haripura?"

		pixel Lien as General Lien "...What about Haripura?"

		pixel Ahlai as <playerName> "I have been... thinking of going on a journey. How do you suppose I could get there?"

		pixel Lien as General Lien "If you head south from Kuchai Town... it's not impossible to reach Haripura. But I recommend that you prepare for this trip with, say, your employer."

		pixel Lien as General Lien "They have been taking in more foreigners, lately. So you could be welcomed, whether for a visit or otherwise."

	- Ask about Dalawi
		pixel Ahlai as <playerName> "<i>Last I remember, Dalawi was taken away to another empire. I think it was the Gataran Empire...</i>"

		pixel Ahlai as <playerName> "With all this news about pirates from the Gataran Empire... forgive the question, but is Ilaisaane the only pirate at large?"

		pixel Lien as General Lien "Certainly not. We still have yet to find the rest of her crew."

		pixel Lien as General Lien "But if you want my opinion, the Gataran Empire should put in more effort in addressing how their pirates cause entire messes in our lands."

		pixel Lien as General Lien "And knowing that we <i>have</i> Ilaisaane, well... I suppose you understand my stance on the Gataran Empire."

		pixel Ahlai as <playerName> "Do you think the pirates report back to them?"

		pixel Lien as General Lien "I am certain at least some of them do. For the pirate woman, I won't divulge."

		pixel Lien as General Lien "But please, if you travel, do so in a legal manner."

	- Ask about Laya
		pixel Ahlai as <playerName> "<i>I remember they mentioned the mines... Laya was taken there. But there are so many mines-which one could I start with?</i>"

		pixel Ahlai as <playerName> "Say, who could I speak to when it comes to the mines in Ihraye?"

		pixel Ahlai as <playerName> "Well, Agon Province has several mineral deposits near its borders. Along with its neighboring territories. That’s likely the best place you could gather. Do you run a business for this sort of work?"

		pixel Ahlai as <playerName> "Thank you! Well, no. But I have been thinking about it."

		pixel Lien as General Lien "Hmm. Good luck on your endeavors, then."

		pixel Ahlai as <playerName> "Oh, you make it sound like a challenge."

		pixel Lien as General Lien "Only if you <i>really</i> want it to be."

	- Ask about Alonay
		pixel Ahlai as <playerName> "<i>I don't even know where they took Alonay... where would I start?</i>"

		pixel Ahlai as <playerName> "If I were looking for someone... where should I begin?"

		pixel Lien as General Lien "That would depend on who you are looking for. I suggest you bring this up with the local authorities here in Kuchai Town."

		pixel Ahlai as <playerName> "Are there more... dangerous parts of the continent, then? That I might end up going to?"

		pixel Lien as General Lien "That would also depend, but I believe you could prepare yourself for that."

		pixel Ahlai as <playerName> "<i>I've already looked all over town. I'm at least sure that Alonay isn't here.</i>"

		pixel Ahlai as <playerName> "<i>And if the Seiyslan authorities are anything like Lien... what help could I get from them, anyway?</i>"

	- Ask about Liwani
		pixel Ahlai as <playerName> "If I were to look for, say, orphaned infants or children, where could I look?"

		pixel Lien as General Lien "...I apologize, I wouldn't know. You may want to speak with someone in the town hall."

		pixel Ahlai as <playerName> "Oh..."

	- Nevermind...
		pixel Ahlai as <playerName> "<i>If I ask him about my family... What if he remembers me from before?</i>"

		pixel Ahlai as <playerName> "On second thought, nevermind..."
