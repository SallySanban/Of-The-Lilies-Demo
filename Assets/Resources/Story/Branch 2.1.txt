Ahlai as You "Oh, you're right! I almost forgot. I'm sorry, Myo. Perhaps we could do it <b>some time tomorrow?</b>"

"Sir Aciano has all this wealth and great accomplishments to go for, but... are you not bothered by how many people are put off by him? I hear he's like this with everyone."

Ahlai as You "Oh? Seiji... Don't tell me, are you jealous of the great governor?"

Seiji [Blush] "Of course not, <playerName>! I'm only  looking out for you. We have been together for almost 10 years now, so it's only natural that I want to do that, to look out for you."

Ahlai as You "And I'm grateful for that, Seiji."

Seiji "There isn't anything I wouldn't do, <playerName>. It's <i>you</i>."

Seiji [Pout] "And if you need me to be with you tomorrow when you meet Sir Aciano, please just let me know. Whatever will be okay for you."

Ahlai as You "I'll let you know, okay?"

"You're already so worried, but you will have to trust me when I say I can likely handle a few drinks with our supplier."

"It's getting late. We should get started on those tasks for the day."
