		pixel Myo "He already took up the time we could've spent enjoying each other's company."

		pixel Myo "Though, I could be persuaded to tell you if you agree to meet like this again sometime."

		pixel Ahlai as <playerName> "Then you've got yourself a deal."

		pixel Myo "Wonderful. Well, if you must know, yes, that was Sir Gascon. He's actually based in Agon Province like me, but he is from the Kingdom of Seiysla."

		pixel Ahlai as <playerName> "Why did he want to conduct business with you, then? Even I could tell from afar..."

		pixel Myo "Ah, that's nothing new. We've worked together in the past. I'll probably see him next week!"

		pixel Myo "I really do help out with businesses if they need it and if it's within my means, as I've mentioned."

		pixel Myo "But honestly... I notice that men like Sir Gascon struggle to see value outside of their work. Aside from their careers as politicians, their businesses, what they wish to <i>gain</i> out of the life they live..."

		pixel Myo "I just worried that if he got his way earlier, his son would have no chance to explore what he likes. And for his own sake, not his father's. I hope you understand?"

		pixel Ahlai as <playerName> "Is this an advance...?"

		pixel Myo "What <i>ever</i> do you mean? Lady Sabina's an excellent seller! I always love the results we get whenever we work together!"

		pixel Ahlai as <playerName> "...Oh, I thought you..."

		pixel Myo "You thought what? That I was referring to you? I mean... you definitely could make a good case for why I should keep coming back to Sabina's Salves."

		pixel Myo "Again... only if you're interested. But, that aside..."

		pixel Myo "...I am genuine when I say that Lady Sabina is an amazing seller of her wares. A good business partner. She also knows how to explain a lot of the potions' good impact in Agon Province."

		pixel Myo "I am personally very excited to see what else the store has up its sleeve. Especially if they've got anything like that Draught of Perpetuity!"

		pixel Ahlai as <playerName> "Myo..."

		pixel Myo "Yes, dear?"

		pixel Ahlai as <playerName> "Damn, I walked into that one-"

		pixel Ahlai as <playerName> "Alright, sir, as long as you remember what I told you. That potion has proper dosages you need to follow."

		pixel Ahlai as <playerName> "Laisa...? You two are acquainted with each other?"

		pixel Myo "Oh, you sound so surprised... let's just say you're right again. We're <i>very</i> well-acquainted with each other."

		pixel Myo "But her piracy... Well, I didn't exactly know about it until the news came to our province's administrative center."

		pixel Ahlai as <playerName> "Will she be detained?"

		pixel Myo "She just might, this time."

		pixel Myo "But I welcome a challenge, one way or another. I don't doubt her capabilities."

		pixel Ahlai as <playerName> "You know, Sir Aciano. Myo. Are you always this forward with your intentions when you... speak with someone like me?"

		pixel Myo "Yes, actually. Transparency's very important in the work I do, but perhaps the same could be said for the relationships I pursue."

		pixel Myo "And why hide the fact that I'm already enamored? That I'm already taken with you?"

		pixel Myo "I won't even force anything like marriage or something so serious with you, haha! Going on any rendezvous or outing with me is only as binding as you want..."
