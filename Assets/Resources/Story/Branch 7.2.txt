Ahlai as You "<b>No, but you should tell me yours first.</b>"

Manju as ??? [Stern] "Are you always this cautious with people you run into at the tavern?"

Ahlai as You "It's only fair! Isn't this your suggestion? Besides, you seem to be the kind who would understand why."

Manju as ??? "You're right. I could understand why."

"..."

"Though, I do have somewhere I need to be. Even if the drinks in the tavern <i>are</i> nice."

Ahlai as You "Nothing nice to say about the patrons?"

Manju as ??? [Smile] "Not unless you want me to waste <i>your</i> time with small talk."

Ahlai as You "No, I just like receiving praise. Anyone would."

Manju as ??? "...You must be <i>wonderful</i> company to keep for small talk, expecting strangers to praise you and give you their names the moment they meet you."

Ahlai as You "Is this your way of making a joke?"

Manju as ??? "You could say that, but it's no more of a joke than seeing the salary I take to translate texts in the library. In any case, I'll be off, then."

Seiji "<playerName>, what did that man tell you? Did you speak to him?"

Ahlai as You "I did, and he  asked for my name. But... I didn't give it to him."

Seiji "Oh, praise Dok'kale. I saw that his robes have the crest of the <b>Order of Hotei</b>, and I was worried you might have said something you shouldn't have..."

Ahlai as You "The Order of Hotei? I haven't ever seen one of them out in the open. Are you sure?"

Seiji "Yes, I saw it clearly. Remember what Lady Sabina told us about them, <playerName>!"

"They go against what our order stands for, against the safeguards we put in place through the potions we make."

"They believe that <b>people should be able to wield magic</b>. As if they're equals with  the gods!"

"The <b>Order of La Liryo</b> has to ensure that <b>magic is being used responsibly</b>. Sabina's Salves might be our front, but we both knew the truth when Lady Sabina took us in..."

"Oh, <playerName>. If you had told him your name... he might figure out where we're from. And we don't know what he might do to you if he finds out you're against his beliefs. Always be careful, <playerName>."

Ahlai as You "Of course. You never fail to protect me, Seiji."

"Now, let's go get those drinks."
