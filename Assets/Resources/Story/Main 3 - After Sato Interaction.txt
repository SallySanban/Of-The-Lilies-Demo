pixel Ahlai as <playerName> "Mr. Sato! You've got beautiful flowers. Looks like the potion's doing wonders."

pixel Sato as Mr. Sato "It's all thanks to you, <playerName>. I'll be visiting Sabina's Salves again soon enough. I'm not sure why these strange occurrences are happening, but it's been more difficult to keep them alive lately."

pixel Ahlai as <playerName> "But where's your wife? You mentioned it was your wedding anniversary."

pixel Sato as Mr. Sato "Oh... well, she's in a happier place now. I believe she is."

pixel Ahlai as <playerName> "Oh, I... I'm sorry, Mr. Sato."

pixel Sato as Mr. Sato "Don't worry about it. It's been a few years already. Sometimes, I do think... What if things happened differently? But there's no point in dwelling over that now."

pixel Ahlai as <playerName> "If you don't mind me asking, sir, what happened?"

pixel Sato as Mr. Sato "They told me that my wife got into an argument with one of the Seiyslan soldiers. I can't remember all the details... but according to them, things didn't go smoothly."

pixel Sato as Mr. Sato "And she was already in fragile health. So when tensions rose, she became overwhelmed and fainted, and she... never woke up since."

pixel Sato as Mr. Sato "At least, that's the story they shared with me... If only I was there to help her..."
