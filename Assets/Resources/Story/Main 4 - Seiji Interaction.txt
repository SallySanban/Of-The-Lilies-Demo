pixel Ahlai as <playerName> "Is there something... wrong?"

pixel Seiji "Didn't you see his robes? It's barely visible, but I caught sight of the crest of the <b>Order of Hotei</b>."

pixel Ahlai as <playerName> "A-are you sure? They usually don't go out in the open. He even told me his name..."

pixel Seiji "You should count on it not being his real one. Remember what Lady Sabina told us about them."

pixel Seiji "They go against what our order stands for, against the safeguards we put in place through the potions we make. They believe that <b>people should be able to wield magic</b>. As if they're equals with the gods!"

pixel Seiji "The <b>Order of La Liryo has to ensure that magic is being used responsibly</b>. It's what the people know us for. It's why we make those potions every day."

pixel Seiji "Just... be careful next time, okay?"

pixel Ahlai as <playerName> "I will, Seiji. Thank you for worrying about me. All things considered, at least we've got the book."

pixel Ahlai as <playerName> "And we're down to our last task of the day! Drinks for Lady Sabina, right?"

pixel Seiji "Yeah, at the <b>tavern</b>."

pixel Ahlai as <playerName> "Then, let's go!"
