Seiji "This darkness... Lady Sabina, what is happening?"

Sabina as Lady Sabina "The gods must be angry, Seiji. Their anger is manifesting itself as curses in nature."

"I can't know for sure what's actually happening... but our situation can only get worse from here."

"We have a duty here at the Order of La Liryo. <b>We cannot allow the threat of these curses to continue.</b>"

"The adjacent effects of these curses could be devastating, ranging from pestilence to calamities..."

"Dok'kale bestowed upon us the sacred art of magic, intending for us to use it wisely."

"That is why La Liryo has dedicated itself to crafting potions for years, in order to reach a balance between Dok'kale's gifts and our human responsibilities."

"But with the manifestation of these curses, I'm afraid this balance may break..."

Ahlai as You "What do we need to do, Lady?"

Sabina as Lady Sabina "I can only think of one solution... There's no telling if it will work... but it will at least alleviate its effects."

"<b>The Ritual of Respite.</b>{a} A powerful banishing ceremony. It's been known to have been used in the past to get rid of negative essence."

"And we will be needing to <b>find the ancient artifacts necessary to perform it</b>."

Seiji "Where can we find these items, Lady?"

Sabina as Lady Sabina "Well, the  artifacts we need have been lost to time. They surely lie beyond Kuchai's borders. You will need to prepare for a journey."

Ahlai as You "A journey? Outside Kuchai Town? Hell, outside of Sagai Province?"

Sabina as Lady Sabina "It's not a task I can ask of you, Ahlai. It's not safe, and... I couldn't bear to see you <i>hurt again</i>."

"Seiji is more experienced and has been trained for combat since he was little. So, Seiji must be the one to go."
