Seiji "Thank you, sir! You'll find the set of potions you ordered here in this crate."

Mr. Quan "And all are in excellent condition! Just as expected."

Ahlai as You "You can always count on us, sir. We'll get going now. Pleasure doing business with you!"

Mr. Quan "Oh, wait! It almost slipped my mind... I need help creating another potion."

"Could you help me collect the components and brew it for me? I'm a little short here at the store. Don't worry-I'll make sure I pay you extra."

Ahlai as You "We're more than happy to help, sir!"

Mr. Quan "That's great! I appreciate it, <playerName>. Here's what I need: a dash of <b>everbark flakes</b>, <b>two silverleaf sprigs</b>, and a sprinkle of <b>pearl shell powder</b>."

"You'll be able to find them in the <b>components shop</b> down the street. Take this bag of coins, go help yourself to anything you'd like after you buy the components!"

Ahlai as You "Thank you very much!"
