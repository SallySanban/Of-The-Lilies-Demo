Ahlai as You "Lady Sabina, where is Seiji?"

Sabina as Lady Sabina "What are you talking about, dear? Seiji has already left."

Ahlai as You "I see... Has Sir Aciano come by since then?"

Sabina as Lady Sabina "I'm sorry dear, it seems Myo won't be able to make it today. I do believe he made the right decision not to come."

"With the onset of the curses, it is best for you to stay indoors. They've only gotten worse since then."

Ahlai as You "Both of them... Seiji needed to leave? When even Sir Aciano couldn't handle the curse this time around?"

Sabina as Lady Sabina "Don't worry too much about Seiji, dear. He can handle himself."

Sabina as Lady Sabina [Worry] "But he was quite sad when he left... He cares for you a great deal, you know."

"Did you get to send him off, or...?"

Ahlai as You "Well, no, but... I just thought... I could spend some time with Myo Aciano."

Sabina as Lady Sabina "Oh, it's a shame he couldn't come. But it would be difficult to meet him until these curses are resolved."

"We can only patiently hope that Seiji gets back safely."
