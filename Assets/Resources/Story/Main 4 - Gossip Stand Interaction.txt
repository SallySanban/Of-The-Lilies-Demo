pixel GossipGirl4 as ??? "What did you hear?"

pixel GossipGirl3 as ??? "Ilaisaane, the Sea Serpent, was captured! They've been tracking her down for weeks."

pixel GossipGirl4 as ??? "Is that right? The Gataran pirate that's been tearing up the streets lately?"

pixel GossipGirl3 as ??? "Yes, her! They've been pursuing her from Agon Province and now she's taken all the way 'till here, in Kuchai Town!"

pixel GossipGirl4 as ??? "They're here in Kuchai? General Lien rarely pays a visit... He's usually up at the capital."

pixel GossipGirl4 as ??? "Maybe we should go and take a look at his attractive face..."

pixel GossipGirl3 as ??? "A good idea!"
